# Sai Kumar Aili


Hi there 👋 My name is Sai Kumar Aili, 
🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing a degree in Data Analytics Engineering with a focus on `data mining, data warehousing, and database administration`. 

🧭 I'm excited to explore the world of data science and work towards becoming a skilled `data scientist`.

👨🏻‍💻 My experience in this field includes coursework in data warehousing, data mining, and machine learning. I've also had the opportunity to work on several projects that have involved `cleaning and analyzing data, building databases, and developing predictive models`.

🎖 In addition to my technical skills, I'm a highly motivated and curious individual with a passion for learning. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding creative solutions using data-driven approaches.

🔍 Currently, `I'm actively seeking summer internships` in the field of data science to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills. If you're interested in learning more about my experience or would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
